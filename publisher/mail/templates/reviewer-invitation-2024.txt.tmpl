Dear {{to_name}},

Thank you for responding to the SciPy 2024 Program Review Committee Interest Form. The results of that form indicate that you are willing to complete full paper reviews for the SciPy Proceedings.

We appreciate your interest and extend this invitation to you become a SciPy 2024 Proceedings reviewer. We hope to hear an acceptance from you via a reply to this email (reply-to: proceedings@scipy.org) by April 9, 2024.

This will be an exciting year for the SciPy Proceedings. Starting this year, the SciPy Proceedings will be hosted by a professional journal publication platform, Curvenote, a sponsor of SciPy 2024. Curvenote is a leader for the development of Myst, the Python markdown for embedding interactive code into scientific publications.

If you accept, the process for reviewing papers will be introduced to you through both written instructions and optional webinars. The Proceedings Committee aims to make this process easy and lightweight for you. In a nutshell, 1) you will view rendered papers on the Curvenote SciPy Proceedings website (announcement coming soon), and 2) you will make review comments on source code (either Myst or LaTeX) for the papers through the normal GitHub pull request review process. Knowledge of Myst or LaTeX is not required on the part of the reviewer. Your job as a reviewer will be to make helpful and friendly comments on the content and style of rendered papers in order to produce the best possible SciPy Proceedings.

Should you accept, you will be assigned a paper to review according to the schedue below based on two factors: 1) the tracks you indicated you would be willing to review on the SciPy 2024 Program Review Committee Interest Form, and 2) the conflict of interest information you have already provided to the program committee, which has been shared with the proceeding committee. The proceedings committee anticipates you will use the GitHub userid you also provided on the interest form for your review work.

The 2024 schedule for the SciPy Proceedings is based around an initial review, a final review, and a final decision. Within the schedule are dates pertaining to three roles: authors, reviewers, and proceedings committee co-chairs.
